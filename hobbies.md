<br> I'm a passionate dance enthusiast, especially in Chinese classical dance. Dance is integral to my life and my go-to for relaxation. When study fatigue sets in, I dance to refresh both mind and body. This hobby keeps me fit and fuels my passion for learning.

<br> I am also a photography enthusiast, particularly passionate about portrait photography. I enjoy the entire process of coordinating outfits, colors, shooting, and editing according to different themes. My love for visual aesthetics is also one of the reasons that inspires my research in multimodal technology.

<br> I am also very fond of long-distance running, particularly because it allows me to strengthen my willpower. Whenever I surpass my own limits, I feel a deep sense of pride.

## Cat Lover

<br> I have a special fondness for cats. Their big, round eyes and faces, combined with their soft, almost pleading voices, make them irresistibly cute. I also greatly admire their independent nature—how they stay true to themselves and are unafraid to reject what they don’t like.
