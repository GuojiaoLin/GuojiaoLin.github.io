  <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <p>I am Guojiao Lin (林国娇), a third-year graduate student at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests include <strong>multimodal large language models, embodied artificial intelligence and recommendation systems</strong>. I am particularly focused on the application of multimodal technology, especially in enhancing a robot's perception in complex environments. My lifelong research goal is to develop general-purpose robots that can adapt to various real-world scenarios, effectively addressing challenges, and achieving true embodied artificial intelligence.</p>
