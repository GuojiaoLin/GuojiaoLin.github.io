## About Me
<img src="file/robot_dream.jpg">

I am Guojiao Lin (林国娇), a third-year graduate student at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests include **<u>multimodal large language models, embodied artificial intelligence and recommendation systems</u>**. I am particularly focused on the application of multimodal technology, especially in enhancing a robot's perception in complex environments. My lifelong research goal is to develop general-purpose robots that can adapt to various real-world scenarios, effectively addressing challenges, and achieving true embodied artificial intelligence.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Shandong University of Science and Technology, where I dedicated significant time to studying programming, participating in professional competitions, focusing on academic writing, and deeply reflecting on my true passions. This period laid a solid foundation for my path into academic research. Additionally, I am a passionate enthusiast of Chinese classical dance, portrait photography, and long-distance running.
